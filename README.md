Working through the cryptopals.com cryptography exercises.

As I get deeper into programming, I find more and more complex exercises that challenge me.
This set of exercises introduces cryptography concepts and algorithms. I have never explored
these ideas in much depth before, but now I am irresistibly drawn to them. This kind of thinking
is exactly what my brain needs.
